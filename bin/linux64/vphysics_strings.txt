\nAt error exit:\n
\nBecause of the high dimension, the min x-coordinate and max-coordinate\npoints are used if the determinant is non-zero.  Option 'Qs' will\ndo a better, though much slower, job.  Instead of 'Qs', you can change\nthe points by randomly rotating the input with 'QR0'.\n

\nIf the input is lower dimensional:\n  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional\n  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should\n    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the\n    correct topology.\n  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points\n    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.\n  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.\n
\nIf the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that\nmay determine an initial simplex:\n  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional\n  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube\n  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points\n  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex\n  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than %2.2g.\n  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.\n
\nIf you need triangular output:\n  - use option 'QJ' to joggle the input points and remove precision errors\n  - or use option 'Ft' instead of 'Q0'.  It triangulates non-simplicial\n    facets with added points.\n\nIf you must use 'Q0',\ntry one or more of the following options.  They can not guarantee an output.\n  - use 'QbB' to scale the input to a cube.\n  - use 'Po' to produce output and prevent partitioning for flipped facets\n  - use 'V0' to set min. distance to visible facet as 0 instead of roundoff\n  - use 'En' to specify a maximum roundoff error less than %2.2g.\n  - options 'Qf', 'Qbb', and 'QR0' may also help\n
\nOutput completed.  Verifying that all points are below %2.2g of\nall %sfacets.  Will make %2.0f distance computations.\n
\nOutput completed.  Verifying that all points are below outer planes of\nall %sfacets.  Will make %2.0f distance computations.\n
\nPrecision problems were detected during construction of the convex hull.\nThis occurs because convex hull algorithms assume that calculations are\nexact, but floating-point arithmetic has roundoff errors.\n\nTo correct for precision problems, do not use 'Q0'.  By default, Qhull\nselects 'C-0' or 'Qx' and merges non-convex facets.  With option 'QJ',\nQhull joggles the input to prevent precision problems.  See "Imprecision\nin Qhull" (qh-impre.htm).\n\nIf you use 'Q0', the output may include\ncoplanar ridges, concave ridges, and flipped facets.  In 4-d and higher,\nQhull may produce a ridge with four neighbors or two facets with the same \nvertices.  Qhull reports these events when they occur.  It stops when a\nconcave ridge, flipped facet, or duplicate facet occurs.\n
\nQhull has finished constructing the hull.
\nQhull has started post-merging.

\nTesting all coplanar points.\n
\nThe center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar\nwith a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for\ncomputing distances is %2.2g.  The center point, facets and distances\nto the center point are as follows:\n\n
\nThe input to qhull appears to be less than %d dimensional, or a\ncomputation has overflowed.\n\nQhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:\n
\nThe min and max coordinates for each dimension are:\n
\nThese points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate that\nthe intersection is degenerate.\n
\nThese points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or\nthey maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points\nare first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.\n
\nThis is the qhull test case.  If any errors or core dumps occur,\nrecompile qhull with 'make new'.  If errors still occur, there is\nan incompatibility.  You should try a different compiler.  You can also\nchange the choices in user.h.  If you discover the source of the problem,\nplease send mail to qhull_bug@geom.umn.edu.\n\nType 'qhull' for a short list of options.\n
\nTo guarantee simplicial output:\n  - use option 'QJ' to joggle the input points and remove precision errors\n  - use option 'Ft' to triangulate the output by adding points\n  - use exact arithmetic (see "Imprecision in Qhull", qh-impre.htm)\n
