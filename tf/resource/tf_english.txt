"Tip_8_33"				"As a Spy, the L'Etranger passively increases your maximum cloak battery and recharges it when you successfully hit an enemy."
"Tip_8_34"				"As a Spy, your Electro Sappers disable Sentry Guns before destroying them. Communicate with your team and sap a Sentry Gun as your teammates attack. This prevents the Sentry from firing and makes it more difficult for an Engineer to repair it."
